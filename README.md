# DESIGN-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-FRACTAL-MICROSTRIP-ANTENNA

Antenna is a transducer designed to transmit or receive electromagnetic waves. Microstrip antenna usually means an antenna fabricated using microstrip techniques on a printed circuit board (PCB). It consists of a conducting patch of any planar or non planar geometry on one side of a dielectric substrate with a ground plane on other side. It is a popular printed resonant antenna for narrow-band microwave wireless links that require semi-hemispherical coverage. Due to its planar configuration and ease of integration with microstrip technology, the microstrip patch antenna has been heavily studied and often used as elements for an array.
For the same patch antenna a new geometry of a rectangular microstrip patch antenna that improves the performance of a conventional microstrip patch antenna. This antenna is designed to operate at 5.38 GHz with enhanced bandwidth of 11.15%. For the desired result, a triangular notch is inserted into the patch antenna. The proposed geometry provides improvement in other radiation parameters like gain, efficiency and impedance behavior, when it is compared with conventional antenna.
